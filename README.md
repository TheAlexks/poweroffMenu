# poweroffMenu

Are you tired of using GUI to shutdown/reboot/suspend? 
If so, I present to you "poweroffMenu".

I think the name explains its purpose.



**How to install it?** 
*(Though, I don't know why would you)*

It is available in PyPI.

```bash
pip3 install poweroffMenu 
```



**NOTE:**
This only works on Linux systems that use systemd as its init system.
